# Hello_World
First Repository

I have taken a new path into the world of computers. It is very exciting and I know this journey I have embarked on will not be an easy one. I want to learn, to learn how to learn. The result I seek is to contribute to the world like the great innovators that came before me. I will master computer programming/ computer science to test myself and also hope to be a motivational exaple to those who will come after.
